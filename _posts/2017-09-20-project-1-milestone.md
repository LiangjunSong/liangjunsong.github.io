# Milestone 1

## Description of your project including the inspiration, social issue, and intended audience for your site.
I would like to present a topic about Asian Stereotypes. It will be more like a presentation, which introduce the funny fact I heard and saw about the stereotypes people have about Asian.

## Visual design for your project. This could be a sample mockup or hand-drawn sketch. You can include multiple designs if you haven't yet decided.
The project will be more like a slides with some great animations. The user can only need to scroll up and down to view the whole page.

## Include any content or sources needed for your site
