# Milestone 1

The graduate project will build on project 2, but with more functionalities and features.
1. Add reply function for the message board.
2. Allow user to upload one image for each message.
3. Add animation when user click on certain star: the camera will focus on the star clicked and message will appear with animation.
4. Add visual effect to each star: star can shine and move around in the space.

The prototype of project 2 can be viewed [here](http://creative.colorado.edu/~liso9349/fwd/project2/project2.html)
