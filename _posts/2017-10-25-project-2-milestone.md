# Milestone 1

For this project, I would like to build a public message board. I will use [three.js](https://threejs.org/) to draw a 3D sky with stars. Each star represents a message made by the user. So for a user, he could view all the message by clicking on those stars existed. Also, the user could create a new message. Once a message is created, it will become a star in the sky and could be viewed by other users. The messages will be stored in the Firebase. The website will get data from the database and generate the 3D scene in real-time every time there is a request.
