## Document the process you went through creating your portal.
At beginning, I tried to build the website from scratch, but I realized that I have to styling every component by myself, such as navigation bar and buttons. Then I look into [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). It provides basic website components like buttons. With that library, I could be more focus on the complex components I would like to build.

## Iterations of your visual design.
User can access to different project/lab by click on each "card" item.

## Describe problems or roadblocks you encountered and how you resolved them (or not)
At beginning, I always found problem on how to make the position of my components changed responsively. After I did some research, I decided to use the grid system of Bootstrap to do the responsive layout.

## Sources you used in creating your portal.
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

## Lessons learned of what worked and what you'd do differently next time.
Next time, I would like to use Bootstrap to build my basic components so that I can be more focused on the more important components, and save my time.
