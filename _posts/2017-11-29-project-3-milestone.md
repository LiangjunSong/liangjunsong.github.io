Music Exploring App

This app will play music according to the keywords that user select or enter. For example, today you feel like want to have some guitar music without singing. You can click 'Guitar' keyword and type 'No vocal.' Then the app will push a piece of pure guitar music to you. Unlike typical music software, this app allows the user to describe what kind of music they want to listen and make choices for the user.

Todos:
1. Connect the page with API
2. Three.js for real-time music visual effect

# Milestone 4
After this project, we found that Vue.js is not as good as we thought at the begin. We choosed it because we would like to learn somehing new. However, the Vue.js and React.js are alike in many ways: They both advocate componentization. Components updates when probs changes. If you know how to use anyone of them, I think there is no need to learn another. All in all, these are my personal thoughs. During the project, we met all kind of problems, and Three.js didn't work on our page. So we finally choose to use Javascript to draw the visual effect in canvas instead.
