Music Exploring App

This app will play music according to the keywords that user select or enter. For example, today you feel like want to have some guitar music without singing. You can click 'Guitar' keyword and type 'No vocal.' Then the app will push a piece of pure guitar music to you. Unlike typical music software, this app allows the user to describe what kind of music they want to listen and make choices for the user.
