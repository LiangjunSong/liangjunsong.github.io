## The concept/theme of your portal.

I tried to build the portal page like a gallery, and each project/lab has a card with its picture and description on it. [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) is used for styling this website.

## Visual design for your portal.

## How it will respond in different environments/devices.

Each item of project/lab will change their position automatically according to different devices user used.

## The structure and flow of your portal (how users will access different types of assignments).
By simply clicking on the link under each card.
