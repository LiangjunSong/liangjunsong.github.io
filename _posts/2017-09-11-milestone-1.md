## The concept/theme of your portal.

I tried to build the portal page like a gallery, and each project/lab has a card with its picture and description on it. [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) is used for styling this website.

## Visual design for your portal.
The portal will have three links: project, lab and journal. project page and lab page will be almost the same since they are all using for demonstration purpose. journal will simply be a link to my journal page.

For project and lab pages, there will always be a navigation bar on the top of the page. Below that, there will be a "card" like item links to each project/lab.

## How it will respond in different environments/devices.

First, the navigation bar will be responsive. When you are on a computer or pad, it will show all the links of the website. If it was on a cellphone, all the links will hide in a drawer on the website.

The position of the cards will also changed according to different devices. If it is a large screen, it will have three of them on each row. Otherwise it have one item on each row.

## The structure and flow of your portal (how users will access different types of assignments).

By simply clicking on the link under each card.
